<h3><em> Educator, Mentor, Learner, Professor</em></h3>
      
<p> I have offically been an educator for over 25 years, but teaching was always in my blood.  As an elementary student, I tutored younger students.  In high school I was a Teacher Assistant and peer tutor, helping others who struggled.  Naturally, when I headed to college I knew I wanted to teach. I have taught grades K-2 in my elementary school career.  I love working with the littles. They are so excited to be in school and to learn!   Afer teaching for many years, I started to be a mentor to student interns and new teachers and noticed how unprepared they are for teaching today. Most had no classroom management class and little expereince with current mathematical and scientific thinking and teaching. A few years ago, I was given the opportunity to teach online college courses.  I enjoyed the new learning and challenges. This has led me to pursue a doctorate in STEM education. I want to help change the way we educate teachers so we can change the way we educate students.  </p>
